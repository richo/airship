airship
=======

Airship is a frontend to groundstation, both in the form of a RESTful api and a
javascript frontend implmented with backbone.

### Browser support

Airship is explicitly a proof of concept. It doesn't attempt to work out if
your browser supports everything it needs. Use a browser that doesn't suck.
